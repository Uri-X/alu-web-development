# Project Title: **HTML Structure Implementation**

## Overview

This project is the first part of a multi-step process where I will be implementing a webpage from a designer file provided in Figma. The focus of this task is purely on **HTML semantics** and **structure**, with no attention to CSS or style for now. The final webpage will reflect the design in Figma, following best practices in HTML5 semantic markup.

## Project Objective

- Implement a webpage layout that closely follows the Figma design file using HTML.
- Write clean and semantic HTML5 structure to ensure accessibility and ease of future styling.
- Prepare the foundation for adding styles, interactivity, and other assets in subsequent stages.

## Figma Designer File

The design reference for this project is provided in Figma. You can view and duplicate the design to your drafts by following the link below:

- [Figma Design File](#) _(https://www.figma.com/design/OpjtdFaBV0aCorql1PKvuy/Homepage-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=QKA9snMFVMIK2j2z-1)_

## Key Highlights

- **No CSS**: This project is focused only on HTML. No CSS styling has been applied.
- **Semantic Markup**: HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc., are used to build a well-structured and accessible document.
- **Accessibility**: Alt text for images and ARIA attributes where necessary for accessibility purposes have been incorporated into the markup.
- **Responsive HTML**: Although no styling is applied, the HTML structure is set up to be flexible for responsiveness when CSS is added.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The core technology used for structuring the webpage.
- **Figma**: Used to reference the design details and translate them into HTML structure.

## Directory Structure

```bash
.
├── index.html         # Main HTML file with the structure
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── assets/            # Folder to hold images, fonts, or any other static resources
    └── images/        # Folder for storing images used in the project
```

## Setup Instructions

To view the webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## HTML Structure Details

Below is a brief breakdown of the HTML structure implemented:

- **Header**: Contains the navigation bar with links to various sections of the page.
- **Main Section**: The core content of the page, including articles, images, and text elements.
- **Footer**: Contains contact information, copyright details, and links to external resources.

```html
<header>
  <!-- Navigation links -->
</header>

<main>
  <!-- Content sections divided into articles and other semantic elements -->
</main>

<footer>
  <!-- Footer with contact info and external links -->
</footer>
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Proper use of semantic HTML elements for better structure and readability.
- Alt text provided for images for screen readers.
- Well-organized content that can be easily parsed by assistive technologies.

## Next Steps

In future iterations, I will add:
- **CSS styling** to match the Figma design closely.
- **Responsive design** principles to ensure the webpage looks good on all screen sizes.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and enhancing user experience.
